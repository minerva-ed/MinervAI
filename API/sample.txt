\section{Binary operation}
\subsection*{Definition: Binary operation}
If $S$ is a set, then a binary operation $*$ on $S$ is a function, that associates to each ordered pair ($s_1, s_2$) of elements in s, an element of S, which is denoted by $s_1 * s_2$.

Note: order matters.

\example
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is a binary operation.
    \item $(\mathbb{Z}, \cdot)$ is a binary operation.
    \item $(\mathbb{Z}, \textbf{divide})$ is not a binary operation.
\end{enumerate}
\definition{Commutative}
$s_1 * s_2 \neq s_2 * s_1$ for some $s_1, s_2 \in S$. Then $*$ is called a non-commutative binary operation.
\definition{Associative}
It is associative if $(s_1 * s_2) * s_3 = s_1 * (s_2 * s_3)$ for all $s_1, s_2, s_3 \in S$.

\subsection*{Examples}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $(\mathbb{Z}, -)$ is not associative nor commutative
    \item Define $M_{2,2} = 2 x 2$ matrices with real entries. Then $(M_{2,2}, +)$ is associative and commutative.
    \item But $(M_{2,2}, \cdot)$ is not commutative but is associative. Because think of matrix multiplication as composition of linear transformations, which is associative but not commutative.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Groups}
\subsection*{Definition: Group}
Suppose that 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $G$ is a set and $*$ is a binary operation on $G$.
    \item $*$ is associative. 
    \item There exists an element $e \in G$ such that $x * e = e * x = x$ for all $x \in G$. 
    \item For each $x \in G$, there exists an element $y \in G$ such that $x * y = y * x = e$. 
\end{enumerate}
Then $G$ is called a group and $*$ is called a group operation on $G$.
\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $G$ is nonempty as there requires to be an identity element.
    \item $e$ is called the identity element of G. ($e$ will be proven to be unique)
    \item $y$ is called the\footnote[1]{The uniqueness of the inverse will be proven in future lectures} inverse of $x$ and is denoted by $x^{-1}$. This goes both ways for $x$ and $y$ as axiom 3 is symmetric.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Definition: Abelian}
If $*$ is commutative, then $G$ is called an abelian group.
\subsection*{Examples}
Consider $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, it is a group.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $+$ is a binary operation on $\mathbb{Z}$.
    \item $+$ is associative.
    \item 0 is the identity element.
    \item If $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, then $-n$ is the inverse of $n$.
\end{enumerate}
\example
Consider $(\mathbb{Z}, \cdot)$, it is not a group. Since 0 has no inverse. But $(\mathbb{Z} - \{0\}, \cdot)$ is a group\footnote[2]{Try proving this}.
\example
General linear group $GL(2, \mathbb{R})$ is the set of all invertible $2 \times 2$ matrices with real entries. Then $(GL(2, \mathbb{R}), \cdot)$ is a group.

\reddate{9/11/2023}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\cdot$ is a binary operation on $GL(2, \mathbb{R})$ because the product of two invertible matrices is invertible since $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}$.
    \item Associative.
    \item $I_2$ is the identity element.
    \item Since $A$ is invertible, $A^{-1}$ is the inverse of $A$.
\end{enumerate}
\example
Special linear group $SL (2, \mathbb{R})$ is the set of all $2 \times 2$ matrices with real entries and determinant 1. Then $(SL(2, \mathbb{R}), \cdot)$ is a group.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\cdot$ is a binary operation on $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ because the product of two matrices with determinant 1 has determinant 1.
    \item Associative.
    \item $I_2$ is the identity element.
    \item Since $A$ is invertible, $A^{-1}$ is the inverse of $A$.
\end{enumerate}
\example
Consider modular set $\mathbb{Z}_n = \{0, 1, 2, \dots, n - 1\}$ with addition modulo $n$. Then $(\mathbb{Z}_n, +)$ is a group.

Note: A Lie group is a special kind of group that is also a differentiable manifold. This means that the set is not just a collection of elements, but these elements have a smooth structure, like points on a curve or surface. Furthermore, the group operations (like multiplication and finding the inverse) are smooth functions.

$GL(n, \mathbb{R})$ and $SL(n, \mathbb{R})$ are examples of Lie groups, because the set of invertible matrices forms an open subset in the space of all matrices and matrix multiplication and inversion are smooth operations, $GL(n, \mathbb{R})$ is a Lie group.

\definition{Order}
    If G is a group and $x \in G$, then G is said to be of \textbf{finite order} if there exists a positive integer n such that $x^n = e$. In this case, the smallest such positive integer n is called the order of x, denoted by $o(x)$. If no such positive integer exists, then x is said to have infinite order and write $o(x) = \infty$.
    \begin{example}
        \hfill
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $(\mathbb{Z}_5, \oplus)$ is of finite order: Consider $o(0) = 1, o(1) = 5, o(2) = 5, o(3) = 5, o(4) = 5$.
            \item $(\mathbb{Z}_5, \oplus)$ is of finite order: Consider $o(0) = 1, o(1) = 4, o(2) = 2, o(3) = 4$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{example}
\definition{Cyclic, Generator}
        A group G is cyclic if $\exists$ G such that $G = \{x^n | n \in \mathbb{Z}\}$.\ x is called a generator of G.
        \subsection*{Notes}
        Cyclic groups are always countable.
        \subsection*{Notation}
        If G is a cyclic group with generator x, then $G = \langle x \rangle$.
        \subsection{Theorem}
        If $G = <x>$. If $o(x) = \infty$, then $x^j \neq x^k$ if $j \neq k$. If $o(x) = n$, then $x^j = x^k$ if and only if $j \equiv k \pmod{n}$.
        \subsection{Theorem} 
        If $G = <x>$, then G is abelian: $\forall a,b, ab= ba$.
        \begin{proof}
            $a = x^j, b = x^k, ab = x^j x^k = x^{j + k} = x^{k + j} = x^k x^j = ba$.
        \end{proof}
        \section{Subgroups}
        \subsection*{Example}
         $G = (\mathbb{R}, +)$ is a group. The subgroups of $G$ are $\{0\}$, $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$, $(n\mathbb{Z}, +)$, $\mathbb{R}$, etc.
        \subsection*{Definition: Subgroups}
        A subset $H$ of a group $(G,*)$ is a group under the operation $*$ if the elements of $H$ forms a group under $*$. In this case, we say that $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ and write $H \subseteq G$.
        \subsection*{Notes}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Identity of H is the same as that of G. (\begin{proof}
                $e_H$ is the identity of H. $e_H^{-1} e_H e_H = e_H ^ {-1} e_H, e_H = e.$
            \end{proof})
            \item Let $a \in H$, let $a {a_{H}}^{-1} = e_H = e$, so $a^{-1}_H = a^{-1}$.
        \end{enumerate}
